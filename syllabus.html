<div id="course-delivery" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Delivery:</h3>
<p>The course will have live synchronous lectures delivered over zoom during the normally scheduled meeting times. All of these live sessions will be recorded and available on Collab to review or for viewing if you cannot make the live session. I will try to keep the class as interactive as we would in an in-person environment, but this depends on your active participation. I encourage you to stop me and ask questions and be ready to answer if I call on you. This also necessitates that you come prepared to class by doing the assigned reading and any assigned exercises.</p>
<p>I am trying to reserve space for group work / office hours to make it easier for you to work together. We will discuss this on the first day of class.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="course-prerequisites" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Prerequisites:</h3>
<p>Students taking this course should have prior knowledge in linear regression analysis (e.g., SYS/STAT 4021/6021, STAT 5120), statistical inference (e.g., APMA 3120), and linear algebra (e.g., APMA 3080). Students should also have a basic working knowledge in a scientific programming language (e.g., R, Python, Matlab). All course examples will be in R (tidyverse dialect).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The course grade will be based on nine homework assignments (36%; 4% each), two take home midterm exams (30%; 15% each), a final project (25%), and class participation/labs/attendance (9%).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Due to our new circumstances, I will give everyone full participate credit. But please do participate if you are able!</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A+: &gt;98%, A: 92-97%, A-: 90-91%, B+: 88-89%, B: 82-87%, B-: 80-81%, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no grade “curving” in this course. However, the lowest homework grade will be dropped.</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be no make-up homework, exams, or quizzes.</li>
<li>Note: There will be no “extra credit” assignments; spend your time on the assigned work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>The exam dates are posted in the Class Schedule (on the course website). Note these now so there are no conflicts.</p></li>
<li><p>All assignment submissions will be made through Collab. Late submissions (even 1 second late) will not be accepted and will receive a score of zero. The time stamps produced by Collab will be the authoritative reference for all such decisions. If you have special circumstances (e.g., a documented physical condition) that prevent you from adhering to the posted deadlines, please inform me at least 1 week in advance of the deadline so that I can make arrangement to accommodate you.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Due to our new circumstances, I understand this policy may be too strict. Please do be in touch with if you are experiencing troubles meeting the deadlines.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Homework solutions will be submitted as RMarkdown source (which will contain the code) and the compiled html/pdf.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles.html">RMarkdown</a> will produce the html/pdf and contain the code.</li>
<li>All code must be easy to follow (e.g., by good commenting)</li>
<li>Mathematical symbols follows LaTex notation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Pre-class assignments (reading and coding) will prepare you for the lecture. Absences or neglect of the pre-class assignments will result in lowering your participation grade.</p></li>
<li><p>The final project allows you to put into practice what you have been learning and demonstrate your mastery of the course material. You must come up with your own project topic. Ideally your project will be related to your current research, job aspirations, or interests.</p></li>

<h3>Recording of classroom lectures</h3>
<p>I will be recording every lecture in order to accommodate students who will be learning remotely. Because lectures include fellow students, you and they may be personally identifiable on the recordings. These recordings may <strong>only</strong> be used for the purpose of individual or group study with other students enrolled in this class during this semester. You may not distribute them in whole or in part through any other platform or to any persons outside of this class, nor may you make your own recordings of this class unless written permission has been obtained from the Instructor and all participants in the class have been informed that recording will occur. If you want additional details on this, please see <a href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/PROV-005">Provost Policy 005</a>.

<li><p>Please keep video on as much as possible. If you have to eat, stretch, yawn, or do something that could distract others, please mute your video. But do turn it back on!</p></li>
<li><p>Please mute your microphone when not speaking.</p></li>
<li><p>Fight against “screen fatigue”. Stand up and stretch, don’t work in the bed, get enough sleep!</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the most helpful moments in class occurs when students ask questions during lecture. Don’t be afraid to ask questions! You can raise a virtual hand if I am on a roll, or just unmute and blurt out your question when I go for a breath. But don’t let zoom stop you from being an active learner.</p></li>

<div id="policy-on-academic-misconduct-honor-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Policy on Academic Misconduct (Honor Code):</h3>
<p>I trust every student in this course to fully comply with all provisions of the University’s Honor Code and work together to maintain UVA’s <a href="https://honor.virginia.edu/overview">Community of Trust</a>. By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the Honor System of the University of Virginia, as well as the following policies specific to this course.</p>
<ul>
<li>All submitted work must be pledged.</li>
<li>All work must be completed individually unless specific permissions are given on the assignment.
<ul>
<li>Homework and in-class exercises can be discussed with classmates, but the final write-up, code, and solutions must be your own. List the names of who you worked with (like a citation).</li>
<li>Exams must be done completely on your own. You are not to discuss exams with anyone except the teaching staff.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You are not permitted to copy code. You will no doubt come across examples on the internet. You can consult them to help understand the concept or process, but code in your own words.</li>
<li>It is a scholarly responsibility to attribute all your work. This includes figures, code, ideas, etc. Think of it this way: Will someone who reads your submission think that it is your original idea, figure, code, etc? Add a link and/or reference to all sources you used to solve a problem. It is really of no value to you when you just copy someone else’s solutions (other then preserve a grade that you didn’t earn).</li>
<li>It is not always easy to tell what qualifies as a violation, so do not be afraid to talk to me about it. Such discussions do not imply guilt of any kind.</li>
<li>All suspected violations will be forwarded to the Honor Committee, and you may, at my discretion, receive an immediate zero on that assignment regardless of any action taken by the Honor Committee.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the course Honor policy. If you believe you may have committed an Honor Offense, you may wish to file a Conscientious Retraction by calling the Honor Offices at (434) 924-7602. For your retraction to be considered valid, it must, among other things, be filed with the Honor Committee before you are aware that the act in question has come under suspicion by anyone. More information can be found at <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu" class="uri">http://honor.virginia.edu</a>. Your Honor representatives can be found at: <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives" class="uri">http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives</a>.</p>

<h3>Discrimination and power-based violence</h3>
<p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - &lt;www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence&gt;. As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you wish to report something that you have seen, you can do so at the <a href="http://justreportit.virginia.edu/">Just Report It portal</a>. The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.</p>

<div id="religious-accommodations" class="section level3">
<h3>Religious Accommodations</h3>
<p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to me by email as far in advance as possible. If you have questions or concerns about your request, you can contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) <a href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance" class="uri">https://eocr.virginia.edu/accommodations-religious-observance</a>. Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework you miss as the result of a religious observance.</p>
